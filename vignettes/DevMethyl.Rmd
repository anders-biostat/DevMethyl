# 1 Introduction

| Epigenetic mechanisms like DNA methylation and histone modification govern the dynamic changes in gene expression that are essential for stem cell differentiation. 
  Understanding the complex interplay between the layers of transcriptomics, epigenomics and genomics is crucial to advancing in developmental and medical research.
| 
| `DevMethyl` is an R package designed for the analysis of single-cell multi-omics data of cells at various differentiation states. 
  It is used to visualize the changes of the epigenetic landscape (DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility) during stem cell progression, while providing access to genomic information like CpG content, genomic and regulatory features. 
  This package was created to provide a easy access to summarized information on any specific genomic region of interest, enabling users to efficiently navigate through extensive data.

## 1.1 DNA methylation

| In the mammalian genome, methylation of CpG dinucleotides is one of the major epigenetic mechanisms. 
  During this process, a methyl group is transferred to the C5 position of the cytosine to form 5-methylcytosine. 
  This modification, especially in promoter and enhancer regions, can repress gene expression by recruiting proteins and binding transcription factors to the DNA. 
  Conversely, demethylation can induce gene transcription (Ambrosi et al., 2017; Moore et al., 2013). 
  Disruption of methylation processes is often associated with various human diseases, with alterations frequently found on CpG islands, in promoters and enhancers (Meier & Recillas-Targa, 2017).
| 
| DNA methylation can also be used to measure chromatin accessibility. 
  Chromatin structure is determined by the binding of nucleosomes and other proteins to the DNA, influencing the access of factors to the DNA, thereby regulating genomic processes (Mansisidor & Risca, 2022). 
  As non-CpG sites are rarely methylated in the mammalian genome, the transfer of a methyl group to a non-CpG site (like GpC) prior a bisulfite sequencing enables the distinction between accessible and non-accessible DNA (Clark et al., 2018).
| 
| Understanding the dynamic changes in these species-specific methylation patterns and chromatin structure during cell differentiation can help elucidate the mechanisms underlying gene regulation, cellular identity and human diseases.

## 1.2 Single-cell triple-omics of adult neural stem cell lineage

| To demonstrate how `DevMethyl` works, we used scNMT-seq data set of the adult neural stem cell lineage obtained from Kremer et al (2022). 
  Single-cell parallel profiling techniques, such as scNMT-seq enable the analysis of multiple genomic properties simultaneously, allowing detailed comparison of transcriptomics and epigenomics at single-cell level. 
  Kremer et al. (2022) used in their experiment astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, quiescent and active neural stem cells (qNSC, aNSC), transit-amplifying progenitors (TAPs) and neuroblasts from the ventricular-subventricular zone (vSVZ). 
  Additionally, they included astrocytes from the stratum, as well as as neuroblasts and neurons from the olfactory bulb.
| 
| After completing scNMT-seq, they performed methylase-assisted bisulfite sequencing (MAB-seq). 
  The resulting genomic reads were trimmed and further processed using the bisulfite read mapper and methylation caller Bismark 0.22.3 (Krueger & Andrews, 2011). 
  Single end alignment was performed to the genome build *GRCm38* (mm10). 
  To discriminate CpG and GpC in the cytosine methylation calls, they used the NOMe-seq option of Bismarkâ€™s coverage2cytosine script.
| 
| The methylation files were analysed using the python package `MethSCAn` (Kremer et al., 2024). 
  `MethSCAn prepare` prepares and stores the methylation data of each chromosome in a Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) matrix in which columns represents the cells and rows represents the base pairs. 
  The methylation data is represented as -1 and 1 (un-/methylated respectively) while missing values are not explicitly recorded.
| 
| Further information about the data acquisition and processing can be found in Kremer et al., 2022 and Kremer et al., 2024.

# 2 Getting Started

| 

## 2.1 Load the package

To analyze your data using `DevMethyl`, we first need to install and load the package.

```{r loading, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# installation?
library(DevMethyl)
```

## 2.2 Preparations

The main function of `DevMethyl` is the visualization of methylation pattern during cellular differentiation.
This package is designed to analyze single-cell bisulfite-sequencing data that has been processed by a methylation caller like Bismark or Biscuit and implemented in the python package `MethSCAn`.

For explanatory purposes, we chose to analyze a simplified numpy sparse matrix of chromosome 8 from scNMT-sequencing of a murine adult NSC lineage.
The sparse matrices contain the CpG or GpC methylation data and were acquired as described above (1.2).
To simplify this analysis we reduced the matrix to the genomic region 8628100-8684100.
These files can be obtained using `load_exdata`.

```{r methyldata}
file_paths <- load_exdata() 

methylpath <- file_paths[[1]]
```

Using DevMethyl's `npz.to.spM`, the Compressed Sparse Row matrix returned from `MethSCAn prepare` will first be converted into a Tsparse matrix employable in R.

```{r npz.to.spM()}
sp <- npz.to.spM(methylpath)
```

Later in the analysis you will need the meta data of the scNMT-seq, containing cell IDs and pseudotime of the cells used.
These cell IDs need to be stored in the column "cell_id_dna" and the pseudotimes in "pt_avg".
Depending on the number of pseudotimes available for your cells you might need to take average values.

```{r meta}
metapath <- file_paths[[3]]

meta <- read.table(metapath, header =TRUE, sep = "\t")

   meta$pt_avg <- rowMeans(meta[44:45], na.rm = TRUE)
```

Further you will need a file mapping each row index of the sparse matrix to its cell IDs.
The file "column_header" contains the column header of the sparse matrix we use (sp), which are the cell IDs.
These cell IDs need to be of the same format as the cell IDs in "meta" and stored in a column called "cell_id" of a data frame.

```{r header}
header <- readLines(system.file("extdata", "column_header.txt", package = "DevMethyl")) %>% as.data.frame()

  names(header)[names(header) == "."] <- "cell_id"
```

```{r header name adjustments, include=FALSE}
header <- header %>%
          mutate(cell_id = sub("_(?!A).*", "",cell_id, perl = TRUE))
```

It might save you time to assign your settings to variables before starting your analysis.
Our transcription reads were mapped to the mouse genome *mm10/GRCm38* and we chose chromosome 8 to analyse the variable region (VR) 8653165-8659055.
For the genome variant you can use either nomenclature (UCSC or GRC).
To compare our VR with non-VRs we chose our region of interest (ROI) 8628200-8684000.
VRs can be discovered using `MethSCAn scan` or you can leave these variables out and continue using a random ROI.
Based on the used sparse matrix and ROI, you might need to adjust your kernel size (hx, ht) and the spacing of the grids in x and t directions (delx, delt).

```{r Settings}
species <- "mouse"
genome <- "mm10"
chr <- 8
rstart <- 8628200
rend <- 8684000
startVR<- 8653165
endVR <- 8659055
hx <- 200
ht <- 0.4
delx <- 20
delt <- 0.04
```

# 3 Visualizing methylation data

To plot your methylation data, start by using `map_methyl` to map your methylation data to the cell IDs and pseudotimes.
`map_methyl` returns a data frame containing the sorted pseudotime (pt) mapped to its methylation status (methyl) for each genomic position (pos).
Inputs required for this functions include the Tsparse matrix with the methylation data, the meta data, the column header of the sparse matrix (cell ids) and the limits of your ROI.

```{r map_methyl()}
mappedpt <- map_methyl(sp, meta, header, rstart, rend)

  mappedpt %>% head()
```

Once you have the mapped pseudotimes and chosen a kernel size, you can smooth the data using `smooth`.
This function will apply a Gaussian filter to produce a matrix with smoothed "methyl" values over a specific grid.
Here, you need the mapped pseudotimes, kernel and grid sizes, and the limits of the genomic position and pseudotimes.

```{r gauss_kernel}
m <- smooth(mappedpt, hx, ht, delx, delt )
```

Finally, you can plot your matrix using `plot_methyl`, the mapped pseudotimes and the limits of your ROI.
This will create a tile plot visualizing how the DNA methylation pattern changes during differentiation.

In this example you can see, especially in the VR 8653165-8659055, major changes of the methylation pattern around ptime 1 and between 5 and 6.
Biological interpretation:---

```{r plot_methyl, fig.width=7}
plot_methyl(m, mappedpt, rstart, rend)
```

The same procedure can be applied to chromatin accessibility data.
In this case, the meta data from the CpG methylation data can also be used for the GpC data set.

```{r accessibility}
# download of example numpy file of GpC methylation (chromatin accessibility)
accpath <- file_paths[[2]]

# convert to a T sparse matrix employable in R
spAcc <- npz.to.spM(accpath)

# preparation of GpC cell IDs
header_acc <- readLines(system.file("extdata", "column_header_accessibility.txt", package = "DevMethyl")) %>% as.data.frame()
 
  names(header_acc)[names(header_acc) == "."] <- "cell_id"

  header_acc <-  header_acc %>%
               mutate(cell_id = sub("_(?!A).*", "",cell_id, perl = TRUE))
  
# map GpC methylation data to the cell IDs and pseudotimes
mappedpt_acc <- map_methyl(spAcc, meta, header_acc, rstart, rend)

# smooth methylation data
mAcc <-  smooth(mappedpt_acc, hx, ht, delx, delt)
```

Plotting the smoothed GpC methylation as a tile plot will show how chromatin accessibility changes during differentiation.
Comparing this to the tile plot of the DNA methylome might provide additional insights.

```{r plot_methyl(access), fig.width=7}
plot_methyl(mAcc, mappedpt_acc, rstart, rend)
```

# 4 Visualizing genomic attributes

To gain a comprehensive outlook of your ROI, you can analyze several genomic attributes using this package.

## 4.1 CpG islands

Use `plot_cpgislands` to download and plot CpG islands within your ROI for the genome version of your choice.
The returned segment plot visualizes the positions and lengths of the islands.
This information is sourced from the UCSC Table Browser data retrieval tool (<https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTables>).

```{r plot_CpGi, fig.width=7}
plot_cpgislands(species, genome, chr, rstart, rend)
```

## 4.2 CpG density

To examine the distribution of CpG sites use `get_cpgs` to receive an integer list containing the genomic positions of the CpG sites found in your ROI.

```{r get_cpgs}
get_cpgs(species, genome, chr, rstart, rend) %>% head()
```

The CpG sites can then be visualized as a bar plot to show the distribution across the genomic region using `plot_cpgs`.
The genomic range is divided into 50 equal parts, and the number of CpG sites are calculated and displayed as a bar for each part.

```{r plot_CpGs, fig.width=7}
plot_cpgs(species, genome, chr, rstart, rend)
```

## 4.3 Genemodel

Comparing methylation patterns to genes and other genomic features can provide valuable insight for biological interpretation.
The function `get_genemodel` downloads the gene annotations within the ROI of the chromosome. Gene annotation includes genes, exons, CDS, start codons, stop codons, five prime utrs, three prime utrs and Selenocysteines.
To do this, extract the genome data set of your chosen species from the Ensembl FTP site (Harrison et al., 2023).
You have the option to either store the file locally and access it via the directory path, or access it directly using its URL.
In addition, the file can be represented as a data frame after reading the GFF file.
You have the same input options when using `plot_genemodel`, `get_regfeat` and `plot_regfeat`.

For our example data, we used release 102 of *mus musculus*, saving it as a data frame to avoid repeated downloads.

```{r genemodel, fig.width=12}
genepath <- readGFF("https://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-102/gtf/mus_musculus/Mus_musculus.GRCm38.102.gtf.gz")

get_genemodel(genepath, chr, rstart, rend) -> genemodel

  subset(genemodel,select=c(1:5,7,11))
```

To plot this data, use `plot_genemodel`, which creates an arrow plot of the genes within the given ROI with colored genomic annotations.

```{r plot genemodel, fig.width=7}
plot_genemodel(genepath, chr, rstart, rend)
```

## 4.4 Regulatory features

The function `get_regfeat` returns a data frame containing start and end positions of enhancers and promoters and other regulatory elements.
For regulatory features, extract the regulation data set of your chosen species from the Ensembl FTP site (Harrison et al., 2023).
For input options see 4.3 Genemodel.

```{r reg features}
regpath <- readGFF("https://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-102/regulation/mus_musculus/mus_musculus.GRCm38.Regulatory_Build.regulatory_features.20180516.gff.gz")

get_regfeat(regpath, chr, rstart, rend) %>% head(1)
```

To plot these features use `plot_regfeat`, which generates a segment plot including a colored annotation of the variable region.

```{r plot features, fig.width=7}
plot_regfeat(regpath, chr, rstart, rend, startVR, endVR)
```

# 5 Creating summary plot

The easiest way to get a comprehensive summary of your ROI, is to use `plot_all`.
This function uses the `DevMethyl` functions and the `patchwork` package to integrate and visualize the previous mentioned information into one single plot.

```{r plot all, fig.height=8, fig.width=10}
plot_all(species, genome, sp, spAcc, meta, header, header_acc, genepath, regpath, chr, rstart, rend, hx, ht, startVR, endVR)
```
